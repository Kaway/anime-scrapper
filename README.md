You don't know where to find your licensed anime ?

## Data sources :
- Crunchyroll
- Netflix ( thanks to http://animeonnetflix.com/ )
- Wakanim
- Anime Digital Network

## Limitations
All data have been gathered with a French IP, so maybe the data will not be accurate for you location.
Netflix data has been gathered through http://animeonnetflix.com, so the animes displayed are only the one avalaible in US (e.g One Punch is not avalaible on Netflix is US, but is in France).
We're ( in fact, I'm ) working to gather data from differents location to build a better database.
